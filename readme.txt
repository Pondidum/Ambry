About:
Ambry is a proof of concept project started mid June 2011. The aim of it is to create a Document Database using a relational database as a back end.  The specific DB used to be the back end should be non-specific, and will provide implementations for MySql and MsSql.

The project name, like most of my projects, is based off a theasaurus lookup of a word that describes what it does.  In this case, I picked it based off the obsolete definiton from Dictionary.com:  "Any of various types of closet or cupboard with doors and shelves."
